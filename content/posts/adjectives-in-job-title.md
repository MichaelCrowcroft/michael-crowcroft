Iâ€™ve recently become interested in the job market again, and itâ€™s weird out there. Building a career in marketing has been a shit show for a while now thanks to the [proliferation of gurus, growth hackers, and ninjas](https://www.marketingweek.com/mark-ritson-maybe-its-just-me-but-shouldnt-an-expert-in-marketing-be-trained-in-marketing/). Marketers have always had a penchant for nonsense, but by the end of 2010s it felt like we were starting to clean house a bit â€“ [we had gone past peak Shingy](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/10/shingy-reflects-on-his-time-at-aol-and-whats-next.html).

However, the lingering impact of the David Shings of the world is that the overton window has shifted, and now **everything** is just a little bit bullshit.

Why canâ€™t companies just hire â€˜marketing managersâ€™ anymore? Instead of keeping things simple marketing jobs are now required to have an array of adjectives thrown in front. If youâ€™re running a B2B SaaS company, and youâ€™re trying to scale, **of course** your marketing team should be digitally savvy and comfortable with CRM tools, marketing automation, and possibly managing webinars â€“ you **donâ€™t** need to call them Digital Growth Marketing Managers to make that clear.

One adjective in a job title is a red flag, more than two is a hard pass.
