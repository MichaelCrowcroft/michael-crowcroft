By far the best lazy day on the beach I’ve had in a long time. Yif, Millie, Ainsley and I pulled up at the Amazona all-inclusive day spa. We lay on day beds, drank cocktails, and ate a lot of food.

When we could muster the energy we went out for a little bit of swimming, and threw a frisbee for a while, but not for too long before returning to the comforts of the day bed. Not as adventurous as going out sailing, but after moving to Toronto and being away from friends and family, it was really nice to just sit around and relax with some familiar faces.

At the end of the day we had to say goodbye Yif and Millie so they can get ready to sail off to their next location. It was sad to say goodbye, if we’re lucky we will see them again this year though!

By the time we were on the ferry home we were exhausted. Takeaway pizza from Jack’s Pizzeria Party Centre was about all we had the energy for.
