We slept in, and were expecting a pretty lazy day for our last day in Cancun. We started off with a quick breakfast at El Agredecido. The food was alright, but the service was pretty average, and we were left waiting a **long** time for the bill.

After failing to go the museum earlier in the week we finally managed to get in. Unsurprisingly a lot of the information was in spanish, but there was a good overview of the Mayan people and descriptions of the artefacts to get a good idea of the local history. Before arriving at Cancun I really thought it was more of a party town with fancy resorts. It has a lot of that, but there really is **a lot** of history to soak up in the region as well, and the museum was well worth the visit.

By the time we finished up at the museum we were already exhausted with the heat so spent the rest of the day lounging around by the pool with a few cocktails and guacamole.

In the evening, we put some party clothes on and dared to venture into the party centre of Cancun to experience Coco Bongo. We had **a lot** of people offer rave reviews of Coco Bongo, but it was hard to get a clear explanation of **what** it is exactly. The ‘main’ character of the shows is The Mask, based on the comics and movie. Imagine if The Mask organised a Vegas style variety show with an open bar in a  Mexican nightclub, and you can probably imagine what Coco Bongo is like.

Once midnight struck the day was wearing pretty heavy despite the access to free drinks, and we stumbled out the back door of Coco Bongo into the street. Seeing that I was with Ainsley, I immediately had someone approach me trying to sell me flowers, I was just sober enough to decline (sorry Ainsley). Instead we got some late night pizza and a cheeseburger.

Eventually we made our way back to the Airbnb for a quick nap, and then we were up early and on a plane home.
