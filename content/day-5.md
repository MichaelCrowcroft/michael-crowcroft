A bit last minute, but we booked ourselves on a bus tour to see Chichen Itza. Departing Cancun at 7:00 was a bit of a struggle, but once we were on the coach it was pretty easy to fall back to sleep.

### Valladolid
Our first stop was a small town built by the spaniards in the 1500s (on top of an old Mayan city. A colorful and vibrant town, with an old Spanish church.

### Xcajum Cenote
Plunging into the earth and nestled among the forest the cenote was absolutely beautiful, and provided a great swimming spot to cool down in.

### Ek Balam
Due to some tension between the local authorities and the Mayan community Chichen Itza was blocked off from public access. Instead the tour took a trip out to the Ek Balam ruins. While not quite as epic as the great Chichen Itza, it offered a wonderful perspective into the scale of development that existed over 1,000 years ago in Mayan cities.

All up, the trip took basically the entire day, once we got back to Cancun we only had time for a quick dinner and then we were off to bed. We ate near our Airbnb at Taquer√≠a Los Chachalacos, a very cheap and cheerful spot.
