After touching down Ainsley and I strolled through a few corridors down to customs. Travelling a few days before New Years quickly seemed like a bad idea, with queues as long as I’ve seen them snaking through the room. Fortunately the lines were moving quickly.

Exiting the airport delivered an almost immediate culture shock. The path out funnelled through a thick row of taxi drivers shouting and whistling to get people’s attention. If you make the mistake of locking eyes with. someone, they would try and corral you into their taxi for a ridiculously priced trip to the hotel zone.

Instead of taking a taxi the plan was to use buses instead, which meant detouring through downtown Cancun. The bus to Cancun was a modern coach with comfortable seats and air conditioning. While nice, it wasn’t a good representation of what the local bus service is like at all. After getting into downtown Cancun the second culture shock came. Downtown Cancun is where the locals live, and not many of them speak English (in hindsight it’s pretty naive to think they would). With the help of google translate and. Some gesturing we were able to get a local SIM card,  and start to get our bearings.

Thanks to a fairly aggressive bus driver it didn’t take long (once we found the bus) to get from Downtown to the Hotel Zone for check in at our Airbnb. By this point it had been a long day, and dinner was required. Fortunately it was only a few steps to go from the Airbnb to the local bar and restaurant centre in the Hotel Zone.

Cancun knows how to party, and most of the bars had an atmosphere more akin to a nightclub, than anywhere you would normally sit and have dinner at. Eventually we settled into Monkey Business for some tacos, guacamole and a few cocktails.
