The most sure sign of mastery is the ability to simplify. Often though, ‘simple’ is mistaken for ‘easy’. When an industry outsider, or a beginner looks at simple work and discounts its value, it’s a sign that they don’t understand the topic.

(Picasso’s ‘Bull’)[https://www.artyfactory.com/art_appreciation/animals_in_art/pablo_picasso.htm] is a great visual representation of the effort required to achieve simplicity. In order to create a simple abstraction of a bull, you must first be able to define the bull in all the depth and detail you possibly can.

This principle applies broadly. If you want to make any simplified abstraction of reality, you must first understand the whole depth of the reality you are looking to abstract from. Doing your 10,000 hours to master a skill, is only just the starting point to achieve simplicity.

Great work stands out because when you see the process and land on a result, it feels **obvious**. The amount of work required to achieve that obvious outcome can’t be discounted though, because it’s only obvious in hindsight. There are no shortcuts.
