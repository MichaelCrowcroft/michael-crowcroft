After a sleep in the day kicked off with brunch at Restaurante Mextreme.  The place was super colourful, and apparently a Tom Cruise movie was filmed here.

After brunch the day **really** started though – next stop Isla Mujares to spend new years with Yif and Millie! A short bus ride to the ferry terminal and we were flying across the water from the mainland (UltraMar run a fantastic service across to Isla Mujares for less than $30 return). One cliche photo later and we were in the Isla Mujares catching up with Yif.

Next to the ferry terminal we walked out to Yif and Millie’s dinghy (I’m not really afraid of the water, but cruising in the harbour in a dinghy is pretty daunting) and went to their boat Maunga Moana. Yif gave us a quick tour of the boat, and it absolutely blows my mind that they’ve been able to create such a nice home that floats on the water :exploding_head:. Power points and lighting powered from the sun, gas to cook, ample water, and even a hot shower!!!

Really, the highlight of the *entire* trip was setting sail on the yacht (luckily Ainsley didn’t crash).

 I’ve never really sailed before (certainly never sailed successfully), so cruising through the water with just the wind in the sails was an incredible feeling. We went out to an underwater museum with reef that is being developed. We didn’t really see any of the sculptures that make up the museum, but we did see a lot of very friendly fish!

The excursion peaked on the return trip as we cruised home while the sun set. The photos are nice, but really can’t do the full experience justice.

By this point it was time to head into the island and get ready to celebrate the new year! First dinner at Taqueria Dominguez.

After dinner we were waiting for the hours to tick down to midnight with a few drinks at El Patio. It’s funny, once you start approaching thirty, midnight feels further and further away. I don’t think I was coming close to matching the kind of energy the locals had.

For midnight we found a spot near the main park on the island to catch a fireworks display  to kick of 2023. This was the point I realised that I had no hope of keeping up with the locals, I was already feeling pretty tired after a long day, but in Mexico, midnight is when the party is just starting.

After the fireworks we didn’t last long, and went back to the boat to spend a night on the water. I was surprised at how calm the waters were (and how comfy the bed was). It was surprisingly easy to sleep on the boat – I slept like a rock through the whole night!
