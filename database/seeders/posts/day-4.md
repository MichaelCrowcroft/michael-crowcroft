Ok, I will admit up front, I kind of messed this day up. Things started off well with a burrito from Surfin’ Burrito next door to our Airbnb. It went downhill quickly from there though.

The first destination for the day was meant to be Museo de Maya, but when we arrived on the bus we found that it’s shut on Mondays. It quickly went downhill from there. The next stop was the beach playa delfines, not far enough away to bother with the bus, but also far enough away that walking in the heat and humidity was difficult.

But the walking didn’t stop there – our next stop was the Mayan ruins at El Rey, we came pretty close to melting into pavement.

El Rey was the first group of Mayan ruins we saw, and we paid a bit extra to get a guided tour. While the ruins weren’t as impressive as you could find at other sites, the tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable (he’d been doing tours at El Rey for nearly 30 years!), and so the tour was incredibly enlightening (also learnt a bit about iguanas).

Already exhausted from walking, we probably should have just gone home, but instead we went to the main shopping complex in the hotel zone – La Isla. At this point I was in a bit of haze from all the walking in the heat, and I don’t really recall much happening at the mall. Sitting down for some ice-cream was probably the highlight.

Once we wrapped up at the mall we cooled off at our Airbnb with the A/C **blasting**. Eventually we recovered our strength and dragged ourselves down the road to Casa Tequila for dinner. While somewhat expensive compared to other places, the service was great and the food was exceptional (we also ordered the largest margaritas I’ve seen which probably didn’t help the price of dinner). We even got to see a mariachi band!
